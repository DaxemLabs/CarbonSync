## How to Report a Bug or Suggest a Feature

If you encounter an issue with the demo platform or have a suggestion:

1. Check the [existing issues](https://github.com/DaxemLabs/CarbonProof/issues) to see if it has already been reported
2. If not, open a [new issue](https://github.com/DaxemLabs/CarbonProof/issues/new) with a clear title and as much detail as possible
3. For demo-specific bugs, include the URL you were using, your browser, and what you expected vs. what happened
