# Pilot Program — Sentinel Rig Beta Fleet
**Daxem Labs · CarbonSync™ · Patent Pending GB2602946.2**

> CarbonSync is now accepting applications for its inaugural beta fleet pilot — a structured 6-month programme designed to validate hardware performance, carbon credit methodology, and commercial viability at scale.

---

## What the Pilot Is

The CarbonSync pilot is a hardware and software deployment across a select group of UK HGV fleets. Sentinel Rigs are installed on participating vehicles and begin capturing verified fuel consumption and emissions data in real time.

The pilot serves three purposes simultaneously:

- **For Daxem Labs:** Generates real-world validation data for Verra methodology submission and hardware DVT sign-off
- **For pilot partners:** Establishes a verified emissions baseline ahead of CBAM (January 2027) and generates carbon credit revenue from day one of deployment
- **For the market:** Creates the first independently verified dataset of HGV emissions reductions using direct hardware measurement — a dataset no competitor can replicate

## What Pilot Partners Receive

| Benefit | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Verified emissions baseline** | Cryptographically signed, audit-ready record of your fleet's actual emissions from the moment rigs are installed |
| **Carbon credit revenue** | 70% of all verified carbon credits generated during the pilot period — paid to fleet operator |
| **CBAM readiness** | Verified actual emissions data satisfies HMRC requirements from January 2027 — no penalty rates, no estimated figures |
| **Dataloom™ AI insights** | Vehicle-specific efficiency analysis — identifies idling patterns, route inefficiencies, and driver behaviour improvements |
| **Priority commercial terms** | Pilot partners lock in preferred hardware pricing and revenue share terms for full commercial rollout |
| **Technical support** | Dedicated installation team. Direct line to engineering team throughout the pilot period |

## What We're Looking For in a Pilot Partner

We are selective about our pilot partners. The right partner is one where the data generated is genuinely useful to both parties.

**Fleet profile:**
- UK-based HGV operator
- Minimum 10 vehicles available for instrumentation
- Diesel-powered fleet (DERV)
- Operating sectors: waste collection, logistics, construction, removals, distribution

**Operational requirements:**
- Willing to allow installation of Sentinel Rig hardware (non-invasive, inline fuel sensor + OBD-II + GPS)
- Prepared to commit to a minimum 6-month data collection period
- Able to provide access to vehicles for installation (estimated 2 hours per vehicle)

**Strategic fit:**
- Active interest in CBAM compliance planning
- Genuine interest in carbon credit revenue as an income stream
- Willingness to provide feedback on platform UX and data outputs

## Pilot Timeline

| Month | Phase | What Happens |
|---|---|---|
| Month 1 | Installation | Sentinel Rigs fitted across agreed fleet vehicles. Platform configured. Data begins flowing. |
| Months 1–3 | Baseline capture | Platform establishes vehicle-specific emissions baselines. AI models calibrate to individual assets. |
| Month 3 | Baseline report | First formal data integrity report delivered to partner — verified baseline emissions profile. |
| Months 4–6 | Optimisation | Dataloom™ AI identifies efficiency opportunities. Driver feedback system activated. Credits begin generating. |
| Month 6 | Pilot completion | Full performance dossier delivered — fuel savings, CO₂ reduced, credits generated, CBAM liability projection. |
| Post-pilot | Commercial rollout | Partner transitions to full commercial deployment on agreed terms. |

## The CBAM Context

The UK Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism goes live **1 January 2027**. From that date, fleet operators without verified emissions data face HMRC default penalty rates — the highest possible CBAM charge applied to estimated, unverified figures.

A pilot starting in Q2 2026 completes its baseline phase by Q3 2026 — giving pilot partners over a full year of verified data before CBAM takes effect. That is enough to demonstrate compliance from day one of the mechanism.

Operators who wait until 2027 to instrument their fleets will spend the first CBAM period paying penalty rates while their data catches up. Pilot partners will not.

## How to Apply

The pilot programme has limited capacity for the initial beta cohort. If you operate a UK HGV fleet and want to discuss participation, get in touch directly.
